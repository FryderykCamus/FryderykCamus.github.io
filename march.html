            <li>I started completing the system documentation. I chose to focus on a few core features, namely; firing, placing ships and winning. I am unsure what I should consider as the full scope of the system that system documentation covers. </li>

            <li>When constructing the data dictionary, I found it difficult to identify the size of each control. However, Microsoft provides variable information of their website for VB code which was invaluable.</li>

          <h2>Less Squares</h2>
          <h5></span> Post by Jonah Smith, Mar 13, 2017.</h5>
          <br>
          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>It would seem logical that the quickest and most efficient way to win a game of battleships is to select squares on a certain diagonal. The smallest ship is two square and so even though only squares diagonally connected would be selected no ship would be missed. Consequently, the number of squares available I halved. Following this logic, I implemented a very small module which simply restricts the computers shots to square on the same diagonal. To determine whether a square apart of this set I simply drew up a grid. One can then see that squares of the diagonal I selected were limited to either both even x and y coordinates, or odd x and y coordinates. Consequently the module was simple in producing.  When I ran an experimenting measuring the difference in times it wasnâ€™t very significant however. This may have been due to my small sample size and number of repetitions however. </li>

          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li> After much experimentation, I implemented the User Guide or help menu. Initially I attempted to use the adobe pdf control, however as well as being aesthetically displeasing, I think it require adobe connect on the computer running it - although uncommon something some might not have. Instead I used images on a new form in a picture box which the user can scroll through. </li>
