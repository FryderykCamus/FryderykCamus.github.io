            <li>Over the last 5 days I have made significant progress in the development of my program. </li>
            <li>I have added and designed all ships as well as the logo and put them into battleships.
              Furthermore I have redesigned modules such as the AI module, firing method which is now mroe elegant.
              As well as adding various small functions and features such as music, randomize, stats, i redesigned the
              users method of moving the ship with a randomize option as well as using the mouse instead of arrow keys.</li>
