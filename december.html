          <li>Today I implemented the beginnings of what seems to be the most challenging aspect yet -
            the AI component where the computer uses logic when selecting what square to target.
            I have been able to get the computer to hit a square around a previously hit square tagged
            'hit', however problems are present and I hope to further develop this functionality which ultimately
            determines the difficulty and quality of the game. </li>

          <li>Today I developed multiple moduels which add battle functionality to the game, the user can
             interact with the actual game and the computer has basic responses and bot elements in palying
             against its human counterpart. At the moment it is only able to randomly select a square to target
             which will be determined as hit or miss.</li>

          <li>Today I worked on creating a module which allows the user to select a boat and then move it with the arrow keys.</li>
          <li>I started working on a module which tracks the coordinates of  each ship and element within. I decided to
             put picture boxes within a panel to make up a ship but accessing certain properties of the pic boxes has
             provided problems related to containers. For example, when finding all controls in the controls collection,
             VB won't identify child controls and I haven't found a function in VB to access child controls yet.</li>
